# Description

## A collection of QOL mods that replace OdinsQOL and give life to your game. Some are by me, some are by others that do what OdinsQOL did, but better.

You can track the changes that I make to the modpack [here](https://github.com/AzumattDev/AzusQOL)

---

The list of mods in this pack will be found on the mod page's listing of dependencies.

`Feel free to reach out to me on discord if you need manual download assistance.`
